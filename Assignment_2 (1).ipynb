        "Ans: Multicollinearity is a phenomenon in which two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other. This can lead to problems with the regression analysis, including unstable estimates of the regression coefficients and difficulty in interpreting the effects of each independent variable on the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "To check for multicollinearity, we can calculate the correlation matrix between all pairs of independent variables. If the correlation between two variables is high (i.e., close to 1 or -1), then there may be multicollinearity present.\n",
        "\n",
        "This code calculates the correlation matrix between all pairs of independent variables in the dataset, excluding the dependent variable 'Dataset'. If there is multicollinearity, we should see high correlations between some of the independent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "If there is evidence of multicollinearity, we may need to consider removing one or more of the correlated variables from the model. Alternatively, we may need to use a different type of model that can handle multicollinearity, such as ridge regression or principal component regression.\n",

The model aims to predict the liver disease status based on the predictor variables such as age, gender, bilirubin levels, liver enzymes, and other laboratory test results.\n",
        "\n",
        "To check the goodness of fit, we can use measures such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and root mean squared error (RMSE). The R-squared value indicates the percentage of variance in the target variable that is explained by the predictor variables. The adjusted R-squared value adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. The RMSE indicates the difference between the predicted and actual values.\n",

        "We can also check the statistical significance of the predictor variables by looking at their coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values. A significant predictor variable should have a non-zero coefficient, a low standard error, a high t-value, and a low p-value.\n",

        "Finally, we should also check the model assumptions, such as linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, and independence of errors. We can check these assumptions by examining the residual plots, such as the residual vs. fitted plot, QQ plot, and scale-location plot.\n",

However, further analysis and testing may be necessary to improve the accuracy of the model and fully understand the relationships between the independent variables and liver disease."
